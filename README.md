# Epytodo
The project idea is to build a Todo List. Thanks to it, you’ll be able to handle all the tasks you need to doeasily!
We will mainly focus on the “backend” side of the project, but feel free to show us what you can bybuilding a “frontend” to your project as a bonus.
Within this project, you’ll have to develop:

1. your MySQL database.
2. A web server using Node.js
